## SFML Maze Generation
This small project uses Prim's algorithm to generate mazes. Prim's algorithm was chosen as it yields the *minimum spanning tree* - in other words, there is a direct path from any cell to any other; perfect for a maze! 

This visualisation draws the maze in stages, showing the generation in action.
